What we want to do today
    1. Build a simple menu on the console
    2. Work with Python's list and dict types
    3. Generate some random entities in the program (because we don't like to type too much)
    4. How to structure this small program :)

Problem statement:
    -- We want to manage a list of cities. Each city has a name, population, country and continent
What the program needs to do (requirements):
    1. Sort the cities
    2. Display the list of cities
    3. Search for a city (using partial, case-insensitve str matching)
    4. Add a city from the console
    5. Add a number of random cities to the list (the number is read from the console)
    6. Quit
