    Practice run for the practical exam, we use one of the previous years' exam subjects
    Solving should take 2.5 hours

    What to be careful about:
        -> First write the domain entities
        -> Work on each functionality in turn (complete func. 1, then 2, ...)
        -> Always have a working program (or be close to one)
        -> NB! We only grade functionalities that work through the UI
        -> commit & push often (when the program is working)
