    1. Implement an optimized version of the merge sort algorithm
        a. Implement Merge Sort + test function
        b. Use the insertion sorting algorithm with the binary search optimization found in the lecture examples
        c. Time the resulting version using the ex18_sort_comparison.py example
        d. Could merging be further improved using exponential search?

    2. Find the smallest number in a list using a recursive divide & conquer implementation. Return None for an empty 
    list. Implement the following variants:
        a. Chip & conquer
        b. Divide the list into halves
