Practice for practical exam - Air Traffic Control

How to proceed with the implementation
    - We only grade working functionalities
    - Implement the domain entities
    - Look to the first graded functionatity
        implement Repository (partial) <- Service (partial)
        <- UI (partial)
    - Always have a working program, or be close to one
    - Commit & push frequently (laptops break down)
    - Read the problem statement carefully (some functions
    can be reused later)
    - Don't implement things that are not required (input/output,
    validation etc.)
